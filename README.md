Photonic Chips
Team Project: use the fucntion of image recognition by Photnic Chips

The second step:
We find an open source to design a simulator pn Python to work. Its fucntion to  realize  speed of photonic chips to recognize pictures
Commuicatiing with Professor Milos. Get some basic inofrmation about Photonice chips. Besides, he thinks our plan is good to do.

The third step:
Complete the simulator, let it can recoginize the image. And by realize the photonic chips' function, help to make the recogition faster and more clear on image.
thinking about the physical device 
If we have the ability, we want to complete these two ways to make a deeper research on photonic hips.
